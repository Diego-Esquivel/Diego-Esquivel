### Here is a md guide

Headings : For compatability you should always include a new line before and after the heading  
<br>
There are 6 levels of headings :  
<br>

#### Pound sign heading : For compatability always place a space between the pounds and the heading text  

\# : Level 1 is one pound char is the largest heading  
\#\# : Level 2 is 2 pound chars is the second largest heading  
\#\#\# : Level 3 is 3 pound chars is the third largest heading  
\#\#\#\# : Level 4 is 4 pound chars is the fourth largest heading  
\#\#\#\#\# : Level 5 is 5 pound chars is the second smallest heading  
\#\#\#\#\#\# : Level 6 is 6 pound chars is the smallest heading  
<br>

#### Alternate heading syntax  

\=\= : Level 1 is any number of double equal signs on the line below the heading text and is the same as one pound char  
\-\- : Level 2 is any number of double hyphen sign on the line below the heading text and is the same as 2 pound chars  
<br>

Paragraphs :  
<br>
Use an empty line to separate one paragraph from another  
Do not start a paragraph with a space or an indent  
<br>         

Line Breaks : For readability IF compatible use the HTML \<br> tag instead of the double space  
<br>
         Use a double space \(aka trailing whitespace) to create a line break then enter/return  
<br>

Emphasis : You can add bold and italic to text  

#### Bold : For compatability use asterisks to bold the middle of a word  

\*\* : Type 1 to bold is 2 asterisks at the start and the end of the text  
\_\_ : Type 2 to bold is 2 underscores at the start and the end of the text  
<br>

#### Italic : For compatibility use asterisks to italicize the middle of a word  

\* : Type 1 to italicize is one asterisk at the start and the end of the text  
\_ : Type 2 to italicize is one underscore at the start and the end of the text  
<br>

Blockquotes : For compatibility place a new line before and after blockquotes  
<br>
\> : Create a blockquote with a \> in front of a paragraph and in front of each line break between paragraphs  
<br>

Nested Blockquotes : For compatibility place a new line before and after blockquotes  
<br>
\>\> : Create a nested blockquote with a double \> in front of a nested paragraph and in front of each line break between nested paragraphs  
<br>

Lists : Indent items to create a nested list
<br>

#### Ordered Lists : For compatibility only use periods  

1\. : Create an ordered list with the number 1 followed by a period then a space and the item text
<br>

#### Unordered Lists : For compatibility pick one list delimiter and stick w/ it  

\- : Type 1 to create a list is one hyphen sign and a space then the item text  
\* : Type 2 to create a list is one asterisk sign and a space then the item text  
\+ : Type 3 to create a list is on plus sign and a space then the item text  
<br>

Nesting elements in lists :  
<br>

Nest elements in lists by adding four spaces or one tab to the list item and then being the element normally  
<br>

Code :  
<br>
\` : Using 1 \` at the start and the end of a word or phrase encodes it as code  
<br>

Escaping Backticks :  
<br>
\'\' : Using 2 \` at the start and the end of a word or phrase encodes all \` in the word or phrase as code
<br>

Code Blocks :  
<br>
Use 4 spaces or one tab at every line to create code blocks  
<br>

Horizontal Rules : For compatibility place a new line before and after a horizontal rule  
<br>
\*\*\* : Type 1 to create a horizontal rule is 3 asterisks on a line by themselves  
\-\-\- : Type 2 to create a horizontal rule is 3 hyphens on a line by themselves  
\_\_\_ : Type 3 to create a horizontal rule is 3 underscores on a line by themselves
